  This dashboard presents the financial data regarding the restaurant's sales for the months of January until March with a total of 5370 transactions.
The total sales were valued at $160.18 thousand, which included sales from its four main categories specifically Italian which accumulated the most sales at 30.88% ($49.46 thousand), Asian at 29.17% ($46.72 thousand), Mexican at 21.72% ($34.80 thousand), and American having 18.23% ($29.20 thousand). Meanwhile, the total average monthly revenue was calculated to be $53.39 thousand dollars.
Based from the analysis of sales, the peak hour was identified to be at 12PM during Mondays, while the lowest sales are during the opening and closing hours which is 10AM and 11PM, respectively. Best selling items were also shown; wherein Korean beef bowl tops the list having $10.55 thousand dollars of value in which it was ordered 588 times. The list was sorted in terms of the total sales of the items, but can also be sorted in terms of the number of times it was ordered.

# Summary
  By analyzing the transaction patterns, it reveals that late evening hours show fewer transactions, while 12 PM is the peak hour for sales which concurs for the lunch time. Additionally, the heatmap demonstrates that the busiest days are Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, with a noticeable decrease in sales on Sundays and in the late evenings. Nevertheless, revenue is comparatively consistent in spite of minor monthly fluctuations, indicating presence of regular customers.
By taking everything into account, the dashboard highlights various key advantages and opportunities for the restaurant. Although American food might benefit from menu innovation or promotion to increase its share, Asian and Italian cuisines appear to be the most popular among consumers based on their good performance. Targeted midday marketing could increase sales at the obvious lunch surge, while dinner specials or unique offerings could enhance the slower evening hours. Furthermore, concentrating marketing activities on the busiest days may help optimize total sales results and client interaction.

# Conclusions
- Despite having a slight decline in sales on February, the monthly revenues can still be considered as stable at around $53 thousand a month.
- Asian and Italian food dominate both overall sales and market share, indicating a high level of consumer demand.
- There were more downtime or slow hours than peak hours, with the majority of transactions occurring at lunch time.
- Sundays and late evenings show a noticeable decline in activity, while Saturdays and the middle of the week (Tuesdayâ€“Thursday) have the greatest levels.

# Recommendations
- With the trend on hourly transactions, it is highly suggested to invest more on lunch promotions to capitalize on the peak hours. This can also be applied on days with high sales to boost revenue.
- Using other strategies such as dinner promotions during slow hours must also be considered to help improve sales.
- To counter low sales, use special offers during holidays, i.e. valentine's day promotions could have helped in achieving more sales on February.
- Create diversity among the menu to present something unique. For example, launch Asian-European fusions to attract customers of both cuisines.
- Do not overlook on low selling items, create twists, combos, or offers to upsell the items.
